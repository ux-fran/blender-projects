# Darius 3D Character Project (Ongoing)

This project is an ongoing effort to create **Darius**, a stylized 3D character designed as the sidekick for **Emilia**, my first sculpt. Darius was conceptualized after I asked ChatGPT to describe a complementary character for Emilia, including giving him a name and personality. The result is Darius—a strong, muscular character with a heroic appearance, designed to complement Emilia’s fierce and determined presence.

### Project Goals

- **Character Development**: Continue developing Darius as a detailed 3D character with dynamic features and armor, complementing Emilia in both style and personality.
- **Modeling and Rigging**: Create a fully rigged, animatable character with emphasis on body movement, facial expressions, and hair dynamics.
- **Texturing and Detailing**: Refine Darius’s textures, materials, and details, including armor, skin, and stylized hair.

### Learning Goals

As part of this project, I'm using Darius as a way to deepen my skills in various aspects of 3D character creation, specifically focusing on the following areas:

1. **Improving Sculpting in Blender**: Focusing on anatomy, detailed features, and stylized design.
2. **Understanding Workflow**: 
   - **Topology / Retopology**: Learning when to retopologize, how to create clean topology, manually retopologizing, and experimenting with RetopoFlow.
   - **Clothing/Armor Creation**: Gaining skills in modeling and sculpting clothing and armor, focusing on functionality and aesthetics.
   - **UV Unwrapping**: Learning the best practices for unwrapping complex models in preparation for texturing.
   - **Texture Painting**: Developing skills in texture painting for creating realistic materials like skin, armor, and hair.
   - **Rigging with Weight Painting**: Exploring rigging and how weight painting influences the deformations in character animation.
   - **Posing**: Learning how to pose the character for animations and visual storytelling.

### Side Quest

During this project, I took on a "side quest" to explore character creation in more depth by working on **Rosa the Anime Girl**. Through this project, I gained a better understanding of anatomy, topology, and rigging, and I'm applying the lessons learned back into the creation of Darius.

### Process Overview (Ongoing)

- **Character Concept**: After Emilia’s creation, I sought to design a complementary character with ChatGPT’s help, leading to Darius as her sidekick.
- **Modeling**: The base mesh and anatomy are in progress, with detailed features being added gradually to bring out Darius’s muscular physique.
- **Rigging**: Upcoming work includes creating a full-body armature and dynamic hair rig for smooth animations.
- **Next Steps**: Sculpting additional details, rigging, and starting the texturing process. Preparing for animation tests and clothing simulations.
