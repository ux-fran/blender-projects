## Turbine Scene Project üå™Ô∏è‚öôÔ∏è  
*Creating the Turbine Scene in Blender*

This project showcases the creation of a **Turbine Scene** using Blender, inspired by industrial designs and atmospheric lighting. The scene was a great opportunity to learn key techniques in 3D modeling, composition, and lighting to create a dynamic, highly detailed environment.

### Project Overview
- **Status**: Finished
- **Goal**: To design a abandoned turbine scene with industrial elements, focusing on lighting, materials, and composition.
- **Art Style**: Realistic industrial design with strong attention to detail and lighting.
- **Tools Used**: Blender 3D for modeling and scene creation, and Photoshop for texture enhancement and post-processing.
- **Project Inspiration**: [4 Things I Learned from Max Hay: Creating the Turbine Scene](https://www.fran43cg.com/blog/2024/06/19/4-things-i-learned-from-max-hay-creating-the-turbine-scene/)

### Key Features
- **Industrial Design**: The turbine is designed with intricate details, giving it a mechanical, realistic feel.
- **Lighting and Atmosphere**: Focused on creating a moody, industrial atmosphere through dynamic lighting and subtle environmental effects.
- **Texturing and Post-Processing**: Used Photoshop to enhance textures and add final touches to the scene.
